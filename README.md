# Text classification

Project Description
<br/>Different text classification approaches were used to classify text into spam and ham.

Implementation steps
<ol>
<li>Loading the data</li>
<li>Preprocessing the data</li>
<li>Converting the data into Bag of words and Bernoulli model</li>
<li>Training models with different approaches such as Multinomial Naive Bayes, Discrete Naive Bayes Logistic Regression and SGD Classifier</li>
<li>Tuning parameters using a validation set for Logistic Regression and using GridSearchCV for SGD Classifier</li>
<li>Evaluating performance metrics - accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score of different models</li>
</ol>
